## End of week warp: Do not fight/go with the Fed as they are the primum movens 
* All in all: US keeps making progress on its economic recovery which drives up long term nomial/real yields. This caused euqity market/EM tumble. With Fed make it clear that they will not act unless labour market is impacted, there is no constraint for yield to rise further.
* Virus side 
    * New cases: US confirmed cases extended downward trend, with weekly high lower than last weekly high, same in UK. In France/Italy/German/Brazil/, daily confirmed cases has picked up.  In other EM like Russia/South African, daily confirmed cases are trending down.
    * Vaccination: 17.3% population has received 1 does and 9% has received 2 does in US. 
    * Mobility: both google and apple data shows the activity is extending upward trend since February.
    * To sum up, US keeps making progress in virus side with less and less daily confirmed case and more and more people get vaccinated. Mobility data can be viewed as an leading indicator also shows the underlying economy keeps the upward trend.
* Economic data
    * ISM Manufacturing PMI beats expectation(60.8 vs 58.6)
    * ADP missed expectation 11.7 vs 20
    * Markit PMI beats expectation 
    * US non-farm payroll beats expectation (379 vs 198)
    * US unemployment rate 6.2, better than expectation 6.3
    * US trade deficit -68.2 bn
    * US initial claims 74.5 vs 75
    * US durable goods 0.4 vs 0.5, trend is up
    * To sum up, this week's economic data keeps confirming the recovery trend in US. Although ADP did surprised to the downside, but this doubt is cleared by the very high nonfarm payroll, which show the strong recovery in the labour market. Unemployment rate has been trending down since the pandemic which is something Fed would like to see.
* Government/Central Bank
    * ECB: we get mixed signal from ECB as Monday Galhau said "can and must react against" any unwarranted rise in bond yields, then Wednesday they downplay the needs for yield curve control, the how ECB will handle the rising yield is still unclear.
    * Fed 
        * This week we have Brainard/Evans/Powell/Bullard/Yellen gave speech
        * Something I realized this week is the reason why we need to keep a close eye on central bank/ government is that they are the person who have the say in determining the economic policy, which has huge impact, or their action is the **endogenous/primum movens** to the market. In this sense, actually economic data comes in second place not because they are not important, but because **it is more important to know policy makers' reaction function to the economic data, what they care and not care, when will they react**. 
        * Come back to the topic, Fed makes it clear in the past that they pay attention to price stability and job market, and they will pay attention to financial market only if its stability has affected the real economy, this is their reaction function to the economic data and price action from market.  This is also the message delivered by Powell this week: market has been talking about the rapid rising nominal/real yield in the long end for the past 3 to 4 weeks as it laid down on the equity market, especially high tech growth stock as the discount rate to calculate the value of future cash flow is up(2Y real rate), dampening the valuation of  these stocks. Treasury market itself also displayed some disorderly move as market depth became very thin on last Thursday and 10Y yield rise 15bps in a day, this has caught attention from Brainard as in Monday  she mentioned the unusual move from Treasury market and said it needs reform, although Wednesday Evans came out stressed again the rising yield is due to market pricing in better economic data, not worry about rising yield.  Because of these moves, market are pricing in that Powell will say something to talk down the long term yield. The price action into Powell speech also confirmed markets are gradually pricing in the expectation that Powell will become more dovish(I see some people confused why Powell speech is dovish but yield is still up, this is because in market, change of level is more important than level) as equity is up and yield is down. However it turned Powell did not become more dovish and his message is that  Fed will act only financial market condition "threaten achieving Fed goal:", which is labour market primarily at this moment.  Friday's better than expectation nonfarm payroll data make me wonder Powell definitely know the data which gives him the courage to say these tough word in Thursday(do not fight the Fed…). 
        * The take away from Powell speech is we are now more clear about what is the Fed current reaction function: as long as the labour market recovery and inflation expectation are not impacted, Fed does not care about the rising yield or equity market. But if market price action impacted the thing Fed cares, they will act.  This disputes market hope of operation twist or YCC and I believe if you think from first principle  about what we are really doing, you will not be bound to some cliché like if yield is 2%, Fed will YCC. You must think why Fed does thing and if that condition holds, instead of following some mainstream story mechanically.
        * The implication from Powell speech is that there is no implicit level from Fed about the long end yield and it can rise as long as the underlying economic data follow Fed's expectation.
	
* US rates
    * Nominal 2/5/10Y changed 1/8/11 bps this week. Curve bear steepening and 2s10s spread higher than the last high in 2016-12-22.
    * Real 2/5/10Y changed -7/5/7 bps this week. Curve bear steepening with front end(<=4Y drop) and long end (>=5Y) rise
    * BEI 2/5/10 changed 9/5/7 bps.
    * In the short end, inflation expectation is dominating as market know the short end rate is anchored by Fed, but as Powell mentioned consistently that Fed will only act when inflation exceeds 2% consistently and the large inflation data in the coming 3 months are due to base effect, market is more and more certain that the inflation could run hot in short term and Fed will not do anything to it because Fed expected short term inflation will run hot. So market pricing higher inflation by long short term BEI, that is why we see the 2Y real yield down. They can also express this view by selling 2Y nominal, but if they do so the yield will up and larger than the Fed rate, at certain degree people will buy the nominal as the yield is promising, which push down the yield again, similar to a negative feedback. But for real yield, there is no this kind of feedback, people will push its yield to the level consistent with market inflation expectation.
    * View on future development of yield
        * Short end: because short end nominal yield is anchored by Fed Fund rate, no expectation of it rising meaningfully, it has been in a very narrow range since the pandemic and Fed consistently confirm they will not change the Fed Fund rate before 2023. But for real yield, it is subject to change based on people inflation expectation. **This is something I need to further study**. Noted current 2Y inflation expectation is strongest since 2007.
        * Long end: 
            * 10Y nominal has back to the level pre pandemic, 10Y real has not so due to the inflation expectation has been strongest since 2013. This is expected as pent up demand plus $2000 pay check each person, it is hardly to see no strong inflation in short term.
            * What caused the rally in 10Y nominal and real yield since 02-10? This is key to understand how it will evolve next. I know inflation expectation does not rise during this period is due to crude oil price increased around 3 dollar. **At this moment, I think there is a high change this is due to accelerating real economic pick up, but I need evidence.   No view at this moment.**
    * Equity market
        * SPX/CCMP declined this week and INDU closed flat although we see a very shar V-shape price action from Friday.
    * Dollar
        * DXY up 0.9 but failed to close above 92, still oscillate between 90 and 92.
        * FXJPEMCS down 0.7(exactly) and extend the loss since 2021-02-24. The trend of dollar decline against EM broadly has stopped since Georgia run-off
        * CNH up 470 bps and close above 6.5
        * This  week dollar continue strong trend against all currency except NOK/CAD/RUB/INR/COP/PHP. For NOK/CAD/RUB I think it is due to rising crude oil price and as oil exporter it is expected their currency strength. But not sure for INR/COP/PHP. The  broader dollar strength is driven by the rising yield in US as a common factor all else equal.
        * DXY clearly broke the trendline since last March, more room for the up side. Will it impact the global recovery story? Something to keep an eye on
    * Gold
        * Gold down 25 dollar this week and it is testing a trendline. I think the current set up is good for a further gold downside.
	
* Trade idea 
    * GLD put.
