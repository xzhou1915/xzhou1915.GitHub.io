Week end wrap (2021-02-28) 
* To sum up, the current trading logic of global recovery is not impacted this week, but we should pay special attention to how Fed to react to this rapidly rising nominal/real rates
* Virus side: the market is trading a global recovery story from pandemic, so it is vital to monitor virus situation. US daily confirmed case is still at a relative low level(70+k), same as last week, however, it did not extend previous weeks downtrend. In the previous weeks, weekly-high is always lower than previous week, but this trend has stopped this week. It is not something we should worry about now, but keep an eye on it as if virus situation become worse and people have same reaction function to it, it will impact economy recovery. In general, the market still perceive the virus situation is becoming better and better.
* Economic data:  
		○ US new home sales beats expectations(92.3 vs 85.6) 
		○ US 20Q4 GDP revised down 0.1% vs expectation(4.1% vs 4.2%)
		○ US jobless initial claims beats expectations(73 vs 82.5)
		○ US durable goods order: beats expectation a lot(3.4% vs 1.1%)
		○ US core PCE price index slightly beat expectation(1.5% vs 1.4%)
		○ All in all, this week's data shows US economy is on track of recovery, did not break current trading logic. New home sales as a contemporary indicator shows that underlying economy is recovery slightly faster than market perceives. However, at this moment, housing market is not a driving factor of economy in US(my take is I did not see people are talking about housing market a lot).  GDP data as a lagging indicator and this week's figure is a second estimate, so not much surprise, just confirming what people already knows.  For initial jobless claims, which is also a contemporary indicator of current economy, but a leading indicator of unemployment. Currently 4 week average number is continuing a downtrend, which  also point to a recovering labor market.  Core PCE price index is better than expectation, and notice this is the inflation measure taken by Fed, this week's data is 1.5%, still below Fed's 2% target, let alone fulfill Fed's commitment of average inflation at 2%.
	• Government/Central Bankers: 
		• ECB: Monday we have Lagarde stating that "ECB is monitoring long end yield as it is used to price loan to household and firms". Friday we have Stournaras came out saying ECB needs yield curve control to fight against the rising yield.
		• Fed: 
			§ Powell had two testimony on Tuesday and Wednesday . The market, especially equity market got really excited on what Powell said. But for me, I think it did not make any sense. What Powell will say on Tuesday can be anticipated because last Friday New York Fed chair Williams already said Fed "not concern for the rising yields" because it is caused by good economy(which is further proved by this week's data). Because of this, Powell cannot say anything else, if he said something different from Williams, that will make market panic about a split Fed, which is bearish for the economy due to the reason that if people who is running central banks do not have the same view on the economy, it must because the road ahead is really uncertain.  The same logic applies to Powell's Wednesday testimony, now not only equity market but rates market join the party, this is even more illogical: Powell can never change his mind with one day(unless saying coronavirus disappear overnight), otherwise people will definitely doubt Fed's credibility. If Fed lose that credibility, it will become a disaster, as all the monetary policy will lose its effects.  
			§ However, when it comes to trading, it is best "focus on what is happening and do not worry about why"
			§ Besides Powell, there are a few other officials speaking, in line with Powell
		• US government
			§ 1.9T package approved as expected.
			§ TGA account reduction. 
		• To sum up, the economy recovery data is in line with Fed's expectation and Fed also reiterates that even though economy is doing good, it is still long way from fully recovery(still 10 million job lost), so they will not change current stance and they will keep the policy moderate. 
		• What we should pay attention to is the current yield rising: MTD US yield up passed 50bps and closed at 33bps, with yield rising 15bps within a single day on Thursday. The Fed's view is that this is due to economy recovery so they did not say anything about it. Real yield also join the rally(a proof that indeed market is pricing in real economy recovery), however, the short end real yield's rising will put equity's valuation under pressure, as  the funding cost rising, that is why we see high tech/growth stock tumbled this week.  The next few weeks will be very important as we will see whether equity market can gradually absorb the rising real yield. If not and market crashed, Fed will probably step out and talk down the real yield, as financial market stability is also something Fed pay attention to(price stability and unemployment rate). The US economy recovery is still delicate, needs to be taken care carefully. 
		• I believe this creates a good trade set up which is to  buy put on NASDQ index, as the payoff is asymmetric: if market gradually absorb the rising yield, NASDQ index could not be rising significant, but if it crashed, it will crashed heavily, and at this moment the implied vol is still relatively cheap.
	• US rates
		• A huge move in US rates this week. 10Y nominal up 25bps during the high and breached 1.6%, the highest since last 02-21, which is even before the pandemic in US.  MTD yield closed 34 bps higher. 10Y real yield same pattern as nominal, ups more than 20bps during weekly high and more than 40bps during monthly high. I did not believe this move is justified, it is too quick and I feel like market is too optimistic about the economy recovery.
		• Inflation expectation side, 10Y BEI barely move this month/week and maintained at 2.1% level. 5Y BEI rising more than 30bps this month and maintained at 2.4% level. 2Y BEI is at 2.4% level but at one moment reach 2.6%.
	• Equity market
		• SPX closed exactly at the level 1 month ago, probably due to the headwind from rising yield this month.  With equity market, value ETF outperform and banking ETF also due to the steepening yield curve.  QQQ tumbled due to rising yield
		• As mentioned above, the fate of equity market is decided by rates market.
	• Dollar
		• DXY rangebound between 89 and 92 this month, the multi month downtrend since last March high is clearly stopped.  And late this week, DXY rising fast. The future path of dollar is also determined by how US real rates will evolve, if it keeps this pace,  with another DM CB's dovish stance(ECB talked YCC and RBA is actually doing it), dollar could start rising meanfully
		• FXJPEMCS: prior to this week, EMFX actually rising slowly, then it is stopped by the rapid rising in US rates. The current rising speed in US rates(34bps) is too fast and EM cannot bear it  as money will flow back to US for higher risk adjusted return. If this high level of nominal and real yield pertain, not good news for EM, and it will also dampen the global recovery logic(reflation trade) that is highly positioned 
	• CNH
		• CNH price action generally follow EMFX, a key level(6.5) is breached. For the future path of USDCNH, I think there is nothing new from CNH side, it is more about how US side will move. 
	• Gold
		• With real yield curve move up meaning fully, it is not a surprise that gold price tumbles, MTD loss 1100 and WTD73 dollar. The gold price is determined by the real yield and the market's perception of real yield in future. With the future path of real yield unclear(whether Fed will talk down real yield). I think XAU will be side way until we are clear about Fed's stance. If Fed reversed market's perception  of real yield, could be a buy point for gold.
	• At this point, we can see almost everything is determined by how US rates will act. This reminds me of a quote: "There is only one true macro trade and that is the price of money. Everything else is a function of the price of money".
