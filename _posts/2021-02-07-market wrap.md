Market movers: 1. Biden will proceed with the 1.9T stimulus plan without Republican's support, using the reconciliation process. 2. January non-farm payrolls turned out to be a downside surprise, with 50k gain bs 100k expectation.

US rates: USGG10YR poses a 10bps weekly gain with a consitent upward price action. While USGGT10Y barely changes between Monday and Friday, but it is bumpy this week, it has a 6 bps gain from Monday to Tuesday but quickly fell to -2bps gain and thus oscillates around -1.03%. Overall, the yield curve keeps steepening this week with long end move higher and short end move lower. As a result of not changing real yield and increased nominal yield, inflation expectation across the curve increases. USGG10Y has exceeded the Januray high on the back of 1.9T stimulus becomes more and more imminent. The non-farm data's large miss seems also help(at least not dampen) the yield increasement in 10Y nominal yield as market thinks like this: bad news -> more stimulus -> good news, this kind of logic is also observed in last month's non-farm payroll miss. 

Overall, my view on us rates is nominal yield will slowly increase on the back of: 1) more debt issuance from US government 2) market gradually price in reduction of QE from Fed, as economy recovery is still on pace. However, Fed will not let the nominal yield rising too fast as it will harm the economy recovery process, so it is likely Fed official will talk down the nominal yield. As for real yield and inflation expectation, if the economy indeed recovery(backed by hard data), the real yield could rise but if we still saw bad economic data(like non-farm miss), what we could see is inflation expectation and nominal yield rise, due to market expectation of more stimulus from government.

More progress on covid relief through reconciliation process, which could end up with 1.9T fiscal stimulus, yield and inflation expectation rises quickly
